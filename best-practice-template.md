# Title

## Summary

High level summary of the best practices taking no more than 1-2 paragraphs, shorter is better.

## Expectations

This section should include who the best practice applies to, in what context it is meant to be used and any other useful information related to expectations on who/what/when it is to be used (or not used).

For example:

> All new users working with someone in CS should be directed to use the below node classification and data best practices.
>
> This best practice may not fit with high complexity environments such as self-service provisioning systems integrated with PE(vRA, Openstack) that require node specific classification

## Best Practice Details

### Preferred Option

The option that we should lead with including a brief explanation of why it is preferred

### Alternate Options

Other *acceptable* options and reasons they might be used instead of the preferred.

### Discouraged Options

Options specifically rejected that need to be called out. Ideally include a brief explanation of why these are discouraged.  Remove this if there are none.

## Other Information

Useful Errata, external links, things to be further defined, etc
